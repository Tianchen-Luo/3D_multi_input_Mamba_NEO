# Voxel-level Radiomics and Deep Learning for Predicting Pathologic Complete Response in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma after Neoadjuvant Immunotherapy and Chemotherapy

## Overview
This is the primary code repository for the research: Voxel-level Radiomics and Deep Learning for Predicting Pathologic Complete Response in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma after Neoadjuvant Immunotherapy and Chemotherapy
Our deep learning model: 3D_multi_input_Mamba was modified based on: https://pypi.org/project/mamba-ssm/

## Usage
1. Install Python 3.10 and you can execute the following command to install required packages.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Other requirements:
- Linux
- NVIDIA GPU
- PyTorch 1.12+
- CUDA 11.8

2. Before training the Multi-inputs 3D-Mamba model, process the data, extracting Voxel-level Radiomics feature maps and make dataloader first
